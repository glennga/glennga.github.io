I love Git. I'll admit, I had a tough time understanding it and the logic behind why we should do it- but it's been a lifesaver so many times. Configuration managment is a very real problem, and Git is now a necessity for every project I start or work on.

## Effective Configuration Management

Git has made the development of several of my group projects much easier. The aspect I'll reference here is _version control_. There comes a time in every project where I'll inadvertedly create a problem that I don't see until 5 or 6 commits later. Sometimes the code is completely different! Version history allows me to see exactly what changes I have made between commits, and it makes the debugging process so much easier.

I've had the wonderful opportunity to work on the COSMOS project, where I could learn and apply the practices of effective configuration managment. I honestly thought it would've been much harder to work with a group of 6 active developers on similar files, but it wasn't that bad. 

	git pull -> (do your work) -> git commit -> git push. 

If there were conflicts, we would talk it out in person or make a new branch. Made an error but didn't commit it yet? Here comes `git reset HEAD` to the rescue! Configuration managment solutions such as Git makes development easier.

## Ineffective Configuration Management

Back in high school, I used to develop routines for robots to follow without any sort of effective configuration management. It was **awful**. As I approached my senior year, I had six years of code for different robots and different versions of the same robot. "Did I write that subroutine for this robot?", "Are the distances and times up-to-date for this routine?", "How did I do this last year?" These were questions that I asked weekly. 

And collaboration? Just as frustrating. I would have to keep emailing with the other programmer, and had to make sure we always had the same changes. It was incredibly time consuming, and it could've been solved with a solution like Git! 

## Github and Git

I started using Bitbucket as my Git host, moved to GitLab, and then ended up on GitHub. I believe GitHub is the best host by a large margin, and that it indeed made Git popular. 

1) You can search for public repositories easily, and this makes contributing to open source code a breeze. This created a strong community around GitHub.
2) An easy-to-use interface online interface which lowers the barrier to move/start a Git project.
3) That tiled contribution visualization on profiles makes users want to fill it with green (maybe, probably not).

## Final Thoughts

Configuration management is tough problem to tackle, but Git is a wonderful solution. Someone once described software development as an actual video game, and pushing changes to a Git repo as creating a checkpoint. You can always go back to this checkpoint if you *die* (mess up some code badly), and other people can start from your checkpoint to help you beat the level. It's not the best analogy, but it got the basic point across to me at the time.
