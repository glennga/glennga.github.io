Software development is hard. Developers are given constraints that are flexible, in a timeline that will change, all while making decisions to deliver your product in a timely manner but will be sustainable in the long run. There's just so much unknownness in development that even the most ideal plan cannot predict:

> Should I sort this list of scores using quicksort or a merge sort?
>
> Should I implement these as methods of some class? Or as a part of some namespace?
>
> Should this sort class hold other sort methods? Should I just make a score class?
>
> Oh god, which platforms does our product have to support? 
>
> ...

If we had our plans laid out perfectly and precisely, we wouldn't need programmers- we would just need typists. Plans are not laid out to this detail, so we have developers to answer these questions and fill in these gaps. One of the gaps I want to address with this essay is the decision to use an existing solution, or craft one in-house. 

## DRH: Don't Repeat History

There's a principle in software engineering called *DRY*: don't repeat yourself. If you need to sort a list several times in your project, don't rewrite the sort every time. Instead write a procedure to accept and sort an arbitrary list, and call this in your code instead. We can extend this concept further into another concept called *DRH*: don't repeat history. Don't repeat yourself, and don't try to solve problems that have already been solved. 

There's a certain beauty in how a company can spend tens of millions of dollars to accomplish a task, and how one individual can accomplish the same task in one afternoon. The article [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-replicated-an-86-million-project-in-57-lines-of-code-277031330ee9) describes this exact scenario. Instead of hiring a bunch of developers to write code for low quality image recognition and processing, one person used a bunch of existing libraries to perform the exact same task. Now obviously a part of the cost goes toward logistics, meeting certain code standards, and interfacing with their private APIs- but what I took from that article is that there are a number of ways to approach such a problem. If you don't have those additional constraints, why reinvent the wheel? 

Personally, this is a big hurdle. Sometimes I really want to implement the solution myself. Sometimes I can't / won't read the documentation behind the existing solution. Sometimes I don't even know that the problem has already been solved with my unwillingness to do more research. A lot of me not implementing someone else's solution is hubris. It's just not as satisfying to say "I solved it using this package". I want to be able to describe what is going on in the background! Unfortunately, this is not the main goal for most of my projects. No, the main goal is often something more significant- and keeping this in sight is vital to delivery.

## Abstraction: You Don't Have to Know Everything

There are two stories I want to touch on: my experience with the Semantic UI framework, and my refusal to use more third party libraries in my Hoku research.

Let's go over the first. In my Software Engineering I class, I was dropped into this odd world of webpage design. I had never constructed a single webpage prior to starting that class, but by the end of the semester I was able to produce beautiful sites that I would enjoy browsing. That's not to say that my journey is over or that it was a walk in the park- learning how to produce these types of webpages is a trial by multiple fires.

I started by learning HTML, the foundation of webpage design. Learning a markup language always involves some sort of learning curve- but using HTML effectively requires climbing this a steep curve for a lot longer (at least for myself). I've come across the terrifying ledges of `<a>`, `<table>`, and `<tr>` tags, hiked the slippery steps of margins & borders, and wrestled with the creature known as CSS. These obstacles are still very much present, but I've had experience with them and know how to overcome them. 

The week after learning HTML, I directed my attention to a framework known as Semantic UI. It was marketed to us as an amazing one-stop solution to tackling web design. Little did I know that this would not only be a trial of fire, but of sharks, tornadoes, and pointy objects. 

Unfortunately, there's no denying it. The Semantic UI framework brings incredible results: beautiful webpages using classes with user friendly names. Creating a visually appealing homepage can now be done as a weekend project, and I have this framework to thank. Semantic UI does a lot of the work for us. One would think that my first week using it should've been a breeze right? Wrong. Placing this work on something external leaves the user clueless about the implementation. I had to place myself inside an entirely different ecosystem to get something relatively straightforward done, and I kept trying to relate this ecosystem back to HTML. This was a mistake. I'm still clueless on what goes on behind the scenes of the Semantic UI framework, but that's okay. I've just learned how to use it as tool and nothing more.

Now let's bring our attention to my Hoku research. This project is probably the largest codebase I've ever developed: 20000 LOC (lines of code) and is still a work in progress! The goal of this project is to implement and analyze five ways of identifying stars in the sky. More information can be found [here](https://glennga.github.io/projects/hoku). I've had such a fun and frustrating time with this project, but it's also been quite educational. One takeaway from this project is that I should've used more 3rd party libraries. 

The problem is that a lot of this code does not follow the *DRH* principle. I made my own vector class to represent a star's position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. I made my own rotation class to rotate these vectors. Hell, I even made my own testing framework. Why did I do this? There are existing libraries for all of these problems that are proven, tested, and have more features! An honest answer is that I just wanted to code. I read all the math in the papers and wanted to put this into my program. I wanted to challenge myself. The problem is that this is not the main challenge. The main challenge is implementing and analyzing star identification techniques. 

Another honest answer is that integrating 3rd party solutions was (and still sort of is) daunting. I would have to sift through documentation to find the method I wanted to use, figure out how to transform my data to fit it's input, and figure out how to interpret it's output. At the time, I felt it was less effort to run through my current workflow. Little did I realize that debugging this untested and unproven code takes even longer than reading a couple of pages. 

I needed to wake up and smell the coffee.

## Closing Statements

There's no shame in using 3rd party libraries. There are bigger goals then trying to implement everything yourself. You have a **real problem** that needs to be solved, and there's no point in reinventing the wheel.
