I'm a very avid user of Stack Exchange. It is an amazing reference for all of my technical classes, as well as technical topics for my job! That being said, it is an art trying to ask and search for the right question to a problem. As with any technical profession, it is impossible to memorize every single detail. Questions will be asked, and they should be done so in a smart manner. This essay refers to my observations on asking Stack Overflow questions.

## Ask smart questions, get smart answers

When smart questions are asked, smart answers are given as a response. This boils down to effective communication. If I ask "How do I sort a list?", there are so many followup questions to ask: "What type of list is this?" "Is the list small or big?" "Is this a programming question?" As I searched for bad questions on Stack Overflow, this was a common theme I noticed. The community wants to see the effort you put into the problem, and a typical one-line question gets the community angry. 

On the other hand, the question should be succinct. Questions should be attractive to smart people, and a tidal of text is not-at-all attractive. I see too many unanswered questions that dump irrevelant log files with long and boring problem explanations on Stack Overflow. Just like in person, conversations must eventually end.

## Ask smart questions in the right place

Let's say we want to find out a answer to sorting a list in Lisp. Would you ask:

1) womenshealthandfitness.com

2) myfoothurtsandidontknowwhy.net

3) stackoverflow.com

I guess I could find an answer on myfoothurtsandidontknowwhy.net, but a large part of asking smart questions is asking the right group. In fact, different communities on Stack Exchange will give much different answers. Ask the Arduino community about a general microcontroller question and they will give you Arduino specific answers. 

When the right community is queried and smart questions are asked, I see much more thought-provoking discussions taking place. Answers are given with justifications, and may occasionally come with additional tidbits that don't pertain to the problem but may help out the original poster later. 

## Reflection

Looking for the difference between bad and good questions on Stack Overflow was an interesting exercise to do. This has made me reevaluate how I ask everyone questions now: from my friends to my professors. Ask the right people, and keep it short but sweet.
