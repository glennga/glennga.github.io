I love git. I'll admit, I had a tough time understanding it and the logic behind why we should do it- but it's been a lifesaver so many times. From version control to cloud storage, configuration management is a necessity for every project I start or work on.

## Effective Configuration Management

Git has made the development of several of my group projects much easier. The aspect I'll reference here is __version control__. There comes a time in every project where I'll inadvertedly create a problem that I don't see until 5 or 6 commits later. Sometimes the code is completely different! Version history allows me to see exactly what changes I have made between commits, and it makes the debugging process so much easier.

For my more solo projects, configuration management has made the process of spreading my code across different computers much easier. Aside

## Ineffective Configuration Management

Back in high school, I used to develop routines for robots to follow without any sort of configuration management. It was absolutely awful. I had all sorts of old code that I would have to sort through, I didn't know when I had written that subroutine, and collaborating was just frustrating. 

## Github Thoughts

I do not think git is popular because of GitHub.
