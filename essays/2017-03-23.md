###  What is Meteor to Me?

A month ago:

> A meteor is some rock that enters Earth's atmosphere. Did I get that right?

Now:

> Meteor is a type of application architecture who's sole purpose is to make life hard for Windows users. One of Meteor's side projects is making web development bearable. 

I'm proud to say that I feel *somewhat* *positive* building a web application now. If you ask me to construct a webpage mockup and add some basic functionality, I'll work slow but it'll get done. On the other hand if you ask me about deployment and project management, I'll throw you a blank face. 

My honest opinion of Meteor? After pulling my hair for weeks, I've grown to appreciate it.

### The Profanity Curve (My Learning Experience)

I don't like to use learning curves for comparison, but rather *profanity curves*. 

Think of the Ackermann function A(n) (m = n here) where n = number of days spent with Meteor and A(n) returns the amount of profanities per hour. To see how fast this function grows, refer to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function). The profanity curve involved with Meteor is this function A(n) from n = [0, 25] days, and e^(-n) + 30 for n = (25, present day].

> Day One: I don't see why everyone is complaining on Meteor, this is -@#$%@#@ okay.

> Day Three: OKAY. Why the @#@@ is this @#*^ not working? I copied this #%@! exactly!

> Day Fifteen: *Buffer Overflow With Swearing* 

> Day Twenty-Six: Alright. I don't know is wrong with this, but I know what to Google. &#&& yes! Found it!

For the first couple of Meteor tutorials, I remember going through the motions and typing everything they were typing. It seemed easy enough, and the result was pretty good. Then I was thrown into cold water trying to understand the concepts without the tutorials. What were these subscriptions? Why wasn't my data showing up? I couldn't even comprehend what templates were. It just seemed easier to go back to good old HTML and Javascript at times.

After wading in the cold water for a while, I was able to take it a little slower. It was here I really had to ground all of the pieces I missed in my last couple of software engineering assignments. In my class, we used the Semantic UI framework with Meteor. Every second spent not understanding containers or grid doubled trying to integrate these with architecture. With most of the front end taken care of, I could now learn what was going on in the back. I took my time learning how to use forms and accounts correctly. I still don't understand a lot of Meteor's features, I've become a lot more comfortable developing with it.

### Meteor: Good and Bad

Let's go over the bad first. 

1. First off, I still have no clue how to easily setup Meteor on Windows. Hardware wise, my Windows laptop should be able to blow my Ubuntu box away with Meteor tasks- but I did some Meteor tutorials on my Ubuntu box and building apps was a lot faster. A good number of profanities that represent the curve above stemmed from not being able to setup Meteor properly and long waiting times. I had to disable my Windows Defender just to build one of the apps! And don't even get me started on Node.js. For those having also having Windows trouble, [this](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s17/morea/meteor-2/reading-meteor-tips.html) link helped me a ton. 
2. The recommended conventions for Meteor are confusing. Maybe it'll click better later, but when I have nine `Add_Home_Page` files and templates I get disoriented trying to read through my code and figuring out which is which. The plus side to having this convention is that I can guess a name while coding and I'll most likely be right.

Now let's go over the good:

1. Using just Javascript and HTML has been great. I have no experience with other architectures, but I understand the difficulty of trying to develop using multiple languages. It's nice to know that I don't have to do that here.
2. Mongo is amazingly simple (once you understand it). This is my first experience with a NoSQL database, and it's been great. I love how well it works with Javascript as well. To me, it just makes sense.

### Conclusion 

I arrived to school. Meteor was there was talking smack about my coding. I'm not going to be handed disrespect like that. We took it to scrap city, and Meteor put me to sleep within the minute. We both got called to the Principal's office (after regaining consciousness). Meteor apologized and we hung out for a little bit. Turns out he's pretty cool. Gave it a couple of days and now we are eating lunch together. We still argue every now and then but we make up within a few hours.
