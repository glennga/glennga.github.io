I'm going to be completely honest- I had no ideas that coding standards existed for the past six years of my 'coding career'. I used to think that large codebases were like the wild wild west: As long as it worked and was readable, no one bated an eye. This past week, I've learned that people do care about style! These people have created tools to enforce certain 'code specifications,' and development environments implement these tools. This relieves my fear of the crazy world I thought software engineering consisted of. 

_Note: I'm using single quotes here so ESLint won't yell at me._

## First Week w/ IntelliJ Idea + ESLint

I have my own squabbles about IntelliJ, but I'll save those for another day. I'm here to talk about _IntelliJ Idea + ESLint_. After getting over the hurdles of installing Node.js and several node packages, I saw this light at the end of tunnel. Except this light was red and was shaped like a circle with an exclamation mark in the middle. In this small snippet of Javascript I was working on, I had __a ton__ of errors: 

> Expected Exception Bloc
> 
> Unexpected String Concatenation
> 
> Unary Operator '++' Used
> 
> Pineapple Pizza Acquired

Seeing these errors didn't make me mad, they made me smile. It was here I realized that these small syntactic differences wouldn't just be flagged for me, they'd be flagged for everyone! The burden of deciding whether to use `num++` vs. `num += 1` was finally lifted. I could now direct my focus to an area that requires more attention: the logic of the code.

## General Coding Standards

Immediately after realizing the power of ESLint, I went to town and got me IntelliJ Idea's brother Pycharm. After switching one of my Python projects to Pycharm from Vim (great decision by the way), I let the Python linter tell me what was wrong. Stating that there were a lot of flags is an understatement, so I went to work and tried to remove as much of those colored lines as possible. Trying to correct these errors made me reconsider a lot of my previous style decisions. For instance, I went from:

	cur.execute("CREATE TABLE SEG{} (hra INT, hrb INT, sep "
				"FLOAT)".format(fovl))
    except:
    	return None 
            
to the code below-

	cur.execute('CREATE TABLE {} ('
				'hra INT, '
				'hrb INT, '
				'sep FLOAT)'.format(tbln))
	except sqlite3.Error:
		return None

Thanks to PyCharm yelling at me, I was 'coerced' into creating the code below. Does it look better? That's debatable. The point here is that I had additional instructions to draft the new code. 

Here's my main point: If everyone on a project works with a coding standard, general development **will** be faster. Partly due to more readable code, but mainly because _everyone_ will have worked with the same standard. The adjustment every programmer makes to understand different styles is no more. Amazing. 

The week I learned this opened my eyes so much. Suddenly, I felt more confident moving forward in my software engineering class. 

## Final Thoughts

Have you ever wanted to teleport? -or move objects with you mind? How about the ability to shoot lasers with your eyes, or easily produce standardized code? Well I'm here to tell you that coding standards allow you to do all of the above except the first three!
