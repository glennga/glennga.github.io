I have no prior experience with Javascript. Given a week with just learning the syntax, I currently enjoy this over C and Java because variable types are not explicitly defined (I really enjoy the `let` keyword). 

With that being said, I still prefer Python over Javascript. I’m not a big fan of curly braces and I prefer Python’s readability. (`x in arr`) is easier for me to understand vs. (`alert(arr.indexOf(x));`). Granted I am a bit of a Python snob, but who knows? Javascript may be my new favorite language over time. 

As far as athletic software engineering goes, I found it to be really fun. The WODs simulate test and interview conditions. These are inevitable stressors, and the ‘athletic training’ will help teach us to manage this under harsher conditions. I’ve found that I can perform well under this type of stress, and I hope this will teach me to work more efficiently under regular conditions. 

I’ve had some time to get used to inverted classrooms, and I do believe it depends on the in-class dynamic. If the professor likes to teach and the rest of the class wants to learn, then I can study at home better. If none of the class did any of the home assignments, then it gets harder for me to ask my peers for help. 

All in all, I've enjoyed the first two weeks of this class. I've had fun with both the class and the material, and I am looking forward to the rest of the semester.
