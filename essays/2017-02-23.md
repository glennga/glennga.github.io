Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

For the past two weeks, I've delved into this odd world of webpage design. Prior to this, I had never constructed a webpage before. Now? I feel like I can produce beautiful sites for people to explore. Learning how to do so was a trial by multiple fires, but I came out alive. 

I started by learning HTML, the foundation of webpage design. Learning a markup language always involes some sort of learning curve- but using HTML effectively requires climbing this a steep curve for a lot longer. I've come across the terrifying ledges of `<a>`, `<table>`, and `<tr>` tags, hiked the slippery steps of margins & borders, and wrestled with the creature known as CSS. These obstacles are still very much present, but I've had experience with them and know how to overcome them. The theme of this essay is _I have the tools, I just don't know how the tools work_. 

## Here Comes Semantic UI to the Rescue! ...?
When I thought that I finally conquered the mountain of web design, I saw another peak in the distance. I took a couple steps closer only to realize that this peak was twice as large as the first one: the Semantic UI peak. 

I saw the results the Semantic UI framework could bring: beautiful webpages using classes with user friendly names. Creating a visually appealing homepage can now be done as a weekend project, and I have this framework to thank. The truth of the matter is that Semantic UI does a lot of the work for us. One would think that my first week using it should've been a breeze right? Unfortunately, placing this work on something else leaves the user clueless about the implementation. In fact I'm still clueless on what goes on behind the scenes of the Semantic UI framework, I've just learned how to use it as tool and nothing more. 

## Building with Bricks Someone Else Made
Sometimes, you just have to let things go. I spent days trying to understand how this one framework worked behind the scenes, and I eventually learned that this is just not necessary. Sure it may come handy down the line, but trying to learn the intricies of something this complex is analogous to writing this entire set of code again by yourself. The entire point of using a framework is use code someone else developed to further a different project.
