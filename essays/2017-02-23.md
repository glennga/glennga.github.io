For the past two weeks, I've delved into this odd world of webpage design. Prior to this, I had never constructed a single webpage before. Now? I feel like I can produce beautiful sites for the internet to explore. That's not to say that my journey is over or that it was a walk in the park- learning how to produce these types of webpages is a trial by multiple fires, and I am still being tested.

I started by learning HTML, the foundation of webpage design. Learning a markup language always involves some sort of learning curve- but using HTML effectively requires climbing this a steep curve for a lot longer (at least for myself). I've come across the terrifying ledges of `<a>`, `<table>`, and `<tr>` tags, hiked the slippery steps of margins & borders, and wrestled with the creature known as CSS. These obstacles are still very much present, but I've had experience with them and know how to overcome them. The theme of this essay is __I have the tools, I just don't know how the tools work__.

## Here Comes Semantic UI to the Rescue! ...?
The week after learning HTML, I directed my attention to a framework known as Semantic UI. It was marketed to us as an amazing one-stop solution to tackling web design. Little did I know that this would not only be a trial of fire, but of sharks, tornadoes, and pointy objects. 

Unfortunately, there's no denying it. The Semantic UI framework brings incredible results: beautiful webpages using classes with user friendly names. Creating a visually appealing homepage can now be done as a weekend project, and I have this framework to thank. Semantic UI does a lot of the work for us. One would think that my first week using it should've been a breeze right? Wrong. Placing this work on something external leaves the user clueless about the implementation. I had to place myself inside an entirely different ecosystem to get something relatively straightforward done, and I kept trying to relate this ecosystem back to HTML. This was a mistake. I'm still clueless on what goes on behind the scenes of the Semantic UI framework, but that's okay. I've just learned how to use it as tool and nothing more.

## Building with Bricks Someone Else Made
Sometimes, you just have to _let things go_. I spent days trying to fully understand this one framework's ecosystem, and I eventually learned that this is just not necessary. Sure it may come handy down the line, but trying to learn the intricacies of something this complex is analogous to writing this entire set of code again by yourself. If everyone started from scratch for every project, nothing would get done. If I tried to replicate a webpage built using Semantic UI with pure HTML and CSS, it would take me days to see a page resembling the one built with a framework. 

The entire point of using a framework is to use code someone else developed to further your own project. I just wish that I had realized this before cursing my computer and Google Chrome for several days.
