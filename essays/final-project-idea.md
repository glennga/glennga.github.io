## Problem & Solution

Problem: TA/Professor avaliability is not always set in stone. Would be nice to know when they are avaliable in real-time.

Solution: App that TAs and Professors can use to tell their students that they are currently available or not.

This app would prevent students from arriving at an office only to find out that they left early for lunch, or are sick today. At a quick glance, you can know if you can go in or not. 

Students can login with their UH Manoa ID.

## Mockup Page

Home Page
- Holds login

New Student User Page
- Table to input all current classes.

New TA/professor User Page
- table to input all current classes.

After Login Page (student)
- Holds table: row of classes, column of specific professor availability, column of TA availability, office hours
- Sees whether it is checked or not
- At the bottom, hold links to class syllabus.

After Login (TAs/professors)
- Holds table: row of classes, column of classes taught
- Can check each column if they are currently available

## Use Case Ideas

New Student goes to home page, logs in, inputs all classes, goes to after-login page and sees if they are available.

Current Student goes to home page, logs in, goes to after-login page and sees if they are available.

New TA/Professor goes to home page logs in, inputs all classes they are teaching, goes to after-login page and checks if they are available or not.

Current TA/Professor goes to home page, logs in, goes to after-login page and uses the checkbox if they are available.

## Beyond the Basics

Automatically get student's classes.

If not, then ask for student schedule every semester.

Extend to all faculty and services (like the helpdesk, etc...).

Schedule one-on-one sessions between student and professor.
