## Problem & Solution

Problem: TA/Professor avaliability is not always set in stone. Would be nice to know when they are avaliable in real-time.

Solution: App that TAs and Professors can use to tell their students that they are currently available or not.

## Mockup Page

Home Page
- Holds login

New User Page
- (if new) Table to input all current classes.

After Login Page (student)
- Holds table: row of classes, column of specific professor availability, column of TA availability, office hours
- Sees whether it is checked or not
- At the bottom, hold links to class syllabus.

After Login (TAs/professors)
- Holds table: row of classes, column of classes taught
- Can check each column if they are currently available

## Use Case Ideas

New Student goes to home page, logs in, inputs all classes, goes to after-login page and sees if they are available.
Current Student goes to home page, logs in, goes to after-login page and sees if they are available.
New TA/Professor goes to home page logs in, inputs all classes they are teaching, goes to after-login page and checks if they are available or not.
Current TA/Professor goes to home page, logs in, goes to after-login page and uses the checkbox if they are available.

## Beyond the Basics

Automatically get student's classes.
If not, then ask for student schedule every semester.
Extend to all faculty (like the helpdesk, etc...)
