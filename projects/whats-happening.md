## What is _What's Happening_?

There isnâ€™t a consolidated place where all events on campus can be posted and viewed easily. Event postings are scattered across different media. As a result, promoters have to work hard to get the word out, and consumers have to work hard to search for these events. The **What's Happening** solution is an application where students can both post and view events that are scheduled or happening on campus. You can visit the website live [here](http://whats-happening-uhm.meteorapp.com/)! 

This application was a project for my Software Engineering class, where me and two other students were tasked to create a web application that solves a problem specific to the University of Hawaii community. My peers and I chose the problem of spreading the word of events, or simply the problem of *what's happening*. 

## The Application (and ICS 314 Project)

Our solution is implemented using a Javascript web framework known as Meteor, with the [meteor application template](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template) serving as our base. The main goal of this project was to exercise everything we learned in the course:

2. HTML, Semantic UI
3. Git, Issue Driven Development 
4. Meteor, Mongo, and Galaxy
5. Keeping a Cool Head (*difficult when approaching deadlines*)

The biggest constraint I had to deal with in my team were our working hours. I preferred to work three hours earlier than they would, and this often resulted in miscommunication and an accu
