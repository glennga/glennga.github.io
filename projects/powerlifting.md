Powerlifting is a competition sport that involves three attempts at a proper *squat*, *bench*, and *deadlift*. The competitor's heaviest sucessful attempts for each different lift contributes to a total. The goal is to have the highest total in their respective weight/age/gender class. 

It may seem like there isn't much to the sport, but there is a lot of science behind this type of training. Personal leverages, when to active muscles, strength tapering, mental focus and diet are some of the few variables involved here. I started training competitively in 2015, and have been going to the gym with this goal in mind ever since. 

Technique is a huge part of what I constantly analyze. Below are my current thoughts before starting every heavy conventional deadlift set:

1. Attach belt, wrist wraps, and chalk to hands. Belt should on 2nd-to-last hole, and wrist wraps should be wrapped so that wrist lies in middle.
2. Walk to center of bar. For Rogue bar, adjust feet to lie approximately at the start of the knurling on each side. Feet should be pointed approximately 5 degrees from the center. 
3. Grab the bar. Left hand should be placed such that palm faces backward and start of knurling lies approximately 1" away. Right hand should be placed similarly, but with the palm facing forward.
4. Roll shoulders up and back to tighten upper back. 
5. Raise butt in air and drop butt back down to engage hamstrings. Angle of knees should be about 100 degrees. Back should not be round.
6. Engage quadriceps and increase grip on the bar. 
7. Push feet into ground violently to straighten knees and squeeze butt to unhinge hips to straighten body. These should occur at the same rate, with knees and hips straightening at the same time.
8. Once knees and hips are vertical (nothing past this), hinge hips and knees to lower the bar. 

I have a set of procedures for each different lift, as well as logs detailing changes to the procedures. In addition to this, I have logs detailing my diet and my programming. The goal is to lift more weight here, and a scientific approach to understanding how I lift under different variables will help me achieve this goal.

Powerlifting has really shaped me into who I am today. I've learned to develop a good base of information before building upward. I've learned to treat every failure as a lesson. I've learned that life is a marathon, not a sprint. I've learned a lot over the years, and know that I have much more to learn.
